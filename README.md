# College Football Comparisons

This package creates a streamlit app that can be found here: https://college-football-comparisons.streamlit.app/.

The app asks the user to select an FBS school and a season (currently 2014-2023). Once a team has been selected, the app displays the team's closest statistical comparisons in the dataset. Closeness is determined by the Statistical Similarity Score (SSS), a custom metric explained below. The user can click on a comparison to view more details about the statistical similarities and differences between the two teams.
